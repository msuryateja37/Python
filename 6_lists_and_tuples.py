# Tuples and list are compound data types and are one of the key types of data structures in python.
# Example
my_tuple = (10,5,8,9,7,5,6,2,3,1,4)
print("example of a tuple")
print(my_tuple)

# In python all variables can be contained in a tuple and its data type is tuple
a = ("surya",10,10.0)
print(a)
